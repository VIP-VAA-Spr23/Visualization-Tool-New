### Overview:
This is a Geographic Information System web app developed for the Video Analytics for Understanding Animal Behavior at Purdue University. Our research team is working to support a larger study investigating chimpanzee hunting behavior by interpreting data captured from motion-triggered camera traps in Senegal. The ultimate aim of this project is to provide primatologists with software to geospatially and temporally visualize prey abundance.

### User Guide:
This program establishes a framework for dynamic information to be displayed when each site marker is selected. Callbacks are used to update the map interface in response to user actions. Session states are used to store user input and keep track of the state of the map across re-runs. Refer to the comments in the `map.py` file for a more detailed explanation for how these features are implemented in the code. 

### Future Work:
- ~~Display Site Markers at each site~~
- ~~Display preliminary classification results for Baboons~~ 
- ~~Toggle Map View from Satellite Imagery to Topographical~~
- ~~Display Sample frames upon clicking site markers~~
- Swap Forecasted Weather API to Historical. Ensure Spatial Resolution of data.
